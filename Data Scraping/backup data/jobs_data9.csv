That is, someone is using it, and it's solving someone's real problem.– Pieter HintjensThe quote above captures the essence of what it means to be a Codium – impact. We pride ourselves in building shit that matters. Shit that is relevant and delivers tangible values. We promise that you will get to use Angular to build stuff that you can brag to your friends about. Our bragging rights includes an Angular 8 app – a football competition system – that has been blessed by FIFA (yes, the global football organization) and is slated to take over (read: deployed to) ASEAN countries in 2021. The best part? This is not your typical startup app that is all hype but no actual users. The app has beenin production for 2 years now.Culture FitIf you don't get excited reading the above paragraph and are wondering if our company provides free lunch and ping pong tables, please stop. Don't apply. Seriously, just go. Away.(For the record, we provide free food (most of the time) but have no ping pong tables. Ping pong tables take too much room and real developers play Xbox or Nintendo Switch anyway. But I digress.)You are not a Senior Code MonkeyYou read that right. We are not a (big) brother corporation looking to hire a Senior Code Monkey (SCM). An SCM is one that, you know, crank out code 24x7 and cannot hold an intelligent, light-hearted conversation with an actual human being.Nay, we actually are a small, close-knit company (45+ people and growing!) that choose to employ people that get excited reading Mr. Hintjens' quote above. Our people also don't consider working from home a company benefit because, dammit! it's more fun working together at the office!Jack of All Trades, Master of AngularThe true perk of working at CODIUM is that you can become the jack of all trades, and are expected to be a master of Angular.At CODIUM, we definitely value your Angular chops. Further, our programmers came from all walks of life, with many of our best programmers coming from reputable companies. Everyone of them gives the same testimonials: at CODIUM, you will get to be the jack of all trades. You won't be just a ""frontend guy."" Like many before you, eventually you will get this itch that you will need to be more. Because when you work with us, you are just a ""frontend guy"" until you eventually get stuck with a bug coming from the backend at 11PM on a Friday night and your colleague already went home. This traumatic experience leaves an annoying itch that eventually leads you to learn about Django, and then Docker, and then AI, and then...one day, you wake up and find yourself becoming a Full-stack developer.Needless to say, as a frontend developer, you have an eye for UX/UI. Of course, you can also hold a non-technical, light-hearted conversation with normal humans. Right? ;-)Tech for The Geek In YouTo continue our geek-speak, here comes the buzzword avalanche that should get your blood pumping more than anunlimited vacationperk:AI, TypeScript rocks,JavaScript sucks,Ngrx, Functional programming, Reactive programming, Asynchronous Programming, Django, Python, Full-Stack = Django + Angular, Flutter, PostgreSQL, Kotlin, Swift, AWS, (Smart use of) Microservice, DevOps, Qt, C++20, Git, Sass, Docker, UX/UI, CI/CD.As mentioned in the ""Culture Fit"" section, you shouldnot apply if all you are looking for is just the typical startup perks. But you shoulddefinitely apply if you have a manic obsession to fix/refactor broken code. You know, itreally bothers you when you see something that is not done right. You shouldreally, definitely, ""please, we beg you"" toapplyif during the work day, you just randomly get up and start helping others less senior than you with their tasks, but stillget your job donewell and on-time.Before you head to the next section, we should also mention to you that every Codium gets an Amazon Echo Dot. AI is the 22nd century infrastructure. Our team is already living it.Full-Stack DeveloperWhat's more? Many of our Angular developers eventually become a Full-stack developer by learning Python and Django. Did we already mention that Python is one of the most in-demand programming languages of the 21st century?Foreigner friendly, English ReadyCambodian, Welsh, Indonesian, American (the CEO), Burmese, Belgian, Iranian, Portuguese, Indian, and Thai. About 10 more nations and we will change our company's name to ""United Codiums."" Seriously now, we are a liberal, progressive company that welcomes (and grants the work permit) to any foreigners that fit our core values.And if you are Thai, we also have weekly English courses to help improve your English fluency. Of course, we trust that you already see the benefit of working in a multi-cultural organization.Knowledge – Not Software – Is Our Firm's Competitive AdvantageWant a true perk? We are one of the few SMEs that pays people up to 30K THB per year to continue their education, be it, getting a master's degree, Udacity Nanodegree, or any online courses that the CEO approves of. Knowledge is our firm's competitive advantage. We Dare You to Take Some DrugsInterested? Wanna learn more? Are you ready to be Codiumified? If so, take the red pill, and read on.https://www.codium.co/careersLet's come move Thailand forward, together. "
