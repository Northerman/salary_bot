These are the only three reasons why you should work.FUN -Fun means working in a business where you believe in the company vision and ethos. Fun on the job means working with people you like and respect. Fun at work includes collaboration, mutual support and a strong bond of shared goals. Fun means winning more than losing, continuous learning, constantly growing as a business person, and doing something you know impacts people in a positive way. That’s fun. And it includes traditional fun too. A workplace where you can have a laugh, where you can socialise easily, enjoy each other’s company and celebrate group and individual success. A job that enhances your self-esteem and sense of worth. Now that’s fun.MONEY -Are you being directly rewarded for your effort and your abilities? Are you able to earn based on your talent rather than your age or social background? Are you getting your fair share of the money you are making your employer? Let’s not be naïve; money is important. It’s important for your own standard of living. It’s important to show your friends how well you are doing. It’s important to help your family. Whatever your reason, money matters and although most of us don’t expect it to just be handed over to us, all we really want is the chance to earn it and earn it well.DOING SOMETHING THAT MATTERS -And I mean REALLY matters. Not something that is superficial and shallow and only pleases for a few minutes. No, I mean something that makes a difference to someone’s life. Something that without your input and influence wouldn’t have shown them a new opportunity and in turn, wouldn’t have improved their life.
